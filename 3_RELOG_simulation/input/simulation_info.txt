The different simulations follow this sctructure:

{date}_{name}_{version}

The simulation folders is generated with the jupyter journal 0_Folder_generation.ipynb.
The notebook generates 6 folders.
 - 2 folders inside input folder, 1 for the solver scenario and 1 for the what-if-analysis (sensitivity analysis).
 - 2 folders inside output folder, 1 for the solver scenario and 1 for the what-if-analysis (sensitivity analysis).
 - 2 folders inside figures folder, 1 for the solver scenario and 1 for the what-if-analysis (sensitivity analysis).

{date}: This entry is autogenerated the day the folders are generated.
{name}: Identifying name.
{version}: Version of the simulation run.

Current simulations in RICE:
  - 20230222_CASE0_v1: This simulation is to check that the Method3 and aggregate waste until 2050 give more reasonable results.
      - Waste method used: Method3 (linear interpolation)
      - Initial amounts file used: 2_data_preparation/RELOG_import_data/Method3/pv_Modules_ia.csv
      - Candidate locations used: 2_data_preparation/RELOG_import_data/CandidateLocations_CA_CASE0.csv
      - Cost assumption mode: Only variable cost, but not sure if it is correct.

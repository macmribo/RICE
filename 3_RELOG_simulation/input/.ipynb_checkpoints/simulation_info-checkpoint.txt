The different simulations follow this structure:

{date}_{name}_{version}

The simulation folders is generated with the jupyter journal 0_Folder_generation.ipynb.
The notebook generates 6 folders.
 - 2 folders inside input folder, 1 for the solver scenario and 1 for the what-if-analysis (sensitivity analysis).
 - 2 folders inside output folder, 1 for the solver scenario and 1 for the what-if-analysis (sensitivity analysis).
 - 2 folders inside figures folder, 1 for the solver scenario and 1 for the what-if-analysis (sensitivity analysis).

{date}: This entry is autogenerated the day the folders are generated.
{name}: Identifying name (user input).
{version}: Version of the simulation run (user input).

Current simulations in RICE:
  - 20230222_CASE0_v1: This simulation is to check that the Method3 and aggregate waste until 2050 give more reasonable results.
      o Waste method used: Method3 (linear interpolation)
      o Initial amounts file used: 2_data_preparation/RELOG_import_data/Method3/pv_Modules_ia.csv
      o Candidate locations used: 2_data_preparation/RELOG_import_data/CandidateLocations_CA_CASE0.csv
      o Cost assumption mode: Only variable cost, but not sure if it is correct.
	
	Notes
       -------
	o HPC throws an error with the what-if analysis. It does not find a solution, here's the error:
		ERROR: LoadError: KeyError: key "Energy" not found
		Stacktrace:

	o I have had this error before when I set up the what-if analysis and the storage % had 0%, maybe this is yelling at me because of the 0 cost? I should check.
